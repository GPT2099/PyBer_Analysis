# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
First using Python and Pandas, we will create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data type by city. Next using Pandas and Matplotlib we will create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. This project will then summarize how the data differs by city type for executives at Pyber in assisting them with future investments and company growth. 

## Resoures
- **Software:** Python 3.9.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3
- **Data Sources:** [PyBer_ride_data.csv](https://github.com/r3ginam/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/PyBer_ride_data.csv), [city_data.csv](https://github.com/r3ginam/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv)

## Results

</p>
The scatter chart shows that the total number of rides per city in order are Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Although Urban cities have the highest frequency of rides, the data shows that the highest fares belong to the Rural cities. This would suggest more people take shorter rides in Urban cities, while Rural trips are longer.
